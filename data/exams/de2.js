        text: "Conversation analysis is a well-defined method and school of thought that analyzes language from a social perspective. It seeks to study meaning occurring talk, either in everyday conversations or institutional settings such as schools and organizations. Any conversation analysis must be strictly based on the spatial conversation, and outside categories found are the more or class of the speakers search to improve unless they are referred to in the conversation being created. Conversation analysis seeks to find out what actions are performed by speakers in conversation (e.g. telling stories, making arrangements), and how they organize their talk in order to do this. They use a special model to analyze its universal flow actions are performed in talk called the next turn proof procedure. In this procedure, the action of the speaker is understood by examining how the listening process can support them. When discussed, the organization defines a conversation analysis use terms such as turns, sequence organization and repair (how speakers fix errors in their talk). When thinking about Conversation Analysis as an argument field, what is object of study? (Stewart 1 answer)",

While trying to replicate one of his professor's experiments, Mohammed notices that another student has made a mistake while calculating the data for the experiment. In one of the equations, one of the steps is done the wrong way. This has made the results of the experiment appear very positive. However, when Mohammed does the calculations, he notes that his results aren't very good at all. Mohammed does the calculations multiple times. He consults a few other students, and they all come up with the same thing. It isn't an assignment, and students are allowed to collaborate and work together, so Mohammed tells the student about the mistake. However, the other student laughs and refuses to change it because it is the same as the one used in the original paper. What is Mohammed required to do? (Choose 1 answer)",
